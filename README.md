# Fake Virus Prank

This is a simple fake virus program that creates a bunch of useless random files within a data folder it creates. It's meant to be a harmless prank to play on your friends. 

## Threadmode vs non threadmode
To change between threadmode, simply change the threadmode variable at the top to 'True' to use threading and 'False' to not.
Threading mode can and most likely will cause your/your friends PC to freeze up, rendering it useless until it's restarted.
